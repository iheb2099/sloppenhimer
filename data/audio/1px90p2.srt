1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
I'm not as embarrassed

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,000
as the title would

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,080
suggest. To set the

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,559
record straight, this happened

5
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,940
on Christmas Day, not

6
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,359
today. So, after a

7
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,359
few too many candles

8
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,759
from my Tannenbaum, I

9
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,740
asked my partner if

10
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:13,419
they'd like to try

11
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:15,380
some wax play. I

12
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,079
had been meaning to

13
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,739
get around to it

14
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:17,800
for a while, and

15
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,980
the holiday season just

16
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,199
sparked my interest again.

17
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,640
My partner eagerly agreed,

18
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:23,859
and we settled in.

19
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:25,760
We discussed where to

20
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,019
apply the heat, I

21
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:27,879
offered to start with

22
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,059
my stomach, and lit

23
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:31,460
the candle. The anticipation

24
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,560
built up, and I

25
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,659
couldn't help but chuckle

26
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,320
at how much I

27
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,280
used to enjoy dipping

28
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
my fingers in wax

29
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,119
as a kid. Just

30
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:38,960
as things were getting

31
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,259
interesting, I heard a

32
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,340
loud noise and felt

33
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,479
a cinderland on my

34
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:44,380
skin. I let out

35
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,920
an involuntary yelp, and

36
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,460
my partner quickly extinguished

37
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,179
the candle. But it

38
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,159
wasn't about me being

39
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,479
startled, that's when I

40
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,219
turned to see our

41
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,619
giant orange cat standing

42
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,020
in the doorway, staring

43
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,700
at us with an

44
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,380
unnerving intensity. Our normally

45
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,420
timid pet was being

46
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,039
its usual intimidating self,

47
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,960
completely unfazed by the

48
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,019
sudden noise. It's a

49
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:05,959
cat who hides from

50
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,040
the vacuum cleaner and

51
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,159
screams for wet food,

52
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,599
but also happens to

53
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:10,519
be terrified of his

54
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,840
own shadow. After calming

55
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,099
our nervous partner down,

56
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,540
the cat slowly backed

57
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,620
away and left us

58
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,840
alone. Needless to say,

59
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,900
things took a bit

60
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:20,620
of a delay in

61
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,579
getting back on track.

62
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:23,519
I've learned that if

63
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,060
I want to dip

64
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,480
into wax again, I

65
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,140
need to make sure

66
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,980
the door is shut,

67
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,280
or risk our orange

68
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,299
tom thinking we're being

69
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:30,540
attacked and going wild.

70
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,359
The moral of this

71
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,760
story. Avoid making loud

72
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,040
noises around your cat

73
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,799
when you're trying to

74
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,099
be intimate, trust me

75
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:38,640
on this one.
