1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,940
I met my wits

2
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,980
end. My husband and

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,720
I have been together

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,179
for eight years, married

5
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:06,099
for just one now,

6
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,160
and we've had sex

7
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,000
only once in the

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,419
past two years, since

9
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:10,400
our daughter was born,

10
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,560
to be exact. We

11
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,179
want intimacy back, but

12
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:14,939
it feels like a

13
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:17,160
distant dream. Our daughter

14
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,480
is 17 months old,

15
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,140
premature at birth, and

16
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,179
spent two weeks in

17
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,920
the NICU. When she

18
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,219
came home, I asked

19
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:25,140
my parents not to

20
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,239
visit her, due to

21
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,339
health concerns for my

22
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,859
severe preeclampsia. But they

23
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,420
showed up anyway, forcing

24
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,299
their way into the

25
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,280
hospital room. When I

26
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,359
tried to limit visitors,

27
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,060
they called me manipulative.

28
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,479
Now, my husband is

29
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,659
saying the same things,

30
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,000
that I'm vindictive and

31
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,340
keeping our grandchild away.

32
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:45,399
This isn't just about

33
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,299
our daughter's visitations, it's

34
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:48,200
about feeling like a

35
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,079
roommate in our own

36
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,280
home. My husband doesn't

37
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,920
defend me emotionally, even

38
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,539
when I need him

39
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,460
most. Like when my

40
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,939
dad passed away, he

41
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:58,119
waited two days before

42
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,140
showing up to comfort

43
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,200
me after playing tennis

44
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,240
with his best friend.

45
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,200
The lack of intimacy

46
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,560
is suffocating. We've tried

47
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,239
sending flirty texts, but

48
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,180
he just laughs them

49
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,180
off. He says he's

50
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,200
too busy working and

51
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,579
providing for us financially,

52
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,780
but that doesn't feel

53
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,760
like an excuse when

54
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
our marriage is struggling.

55
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,859
I'm trying to salvage

56
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:18,620
what's left of our

57
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,760
relationship with the help

58
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
of a marital counselor.

59
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,739
But every time I

60
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,060
bring up issues, it

61
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,239
feels like throwing words

62
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,019
at a wall. I

63
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:27,879
want to feel wanted

64
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,939
by my husband again,

65
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,120
but he seems too

66
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,840
caught up in his

67
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,719
own world. Is this

68
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,340
relationship even worth saving,

69
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:35,260
or is it just

70
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,200
slowly crashing?
