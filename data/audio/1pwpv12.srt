1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,760
I work at a

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,820
liquor store on Christmas

3
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,160
Day, which is usually

4
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,240
pretty slow. As my

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,120
shift drew to a

6
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,299
close, I and my

7
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,439
coworker were bored out

8
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:09,500
of our minds, so

9
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,539
we started having fun.

10
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,619
We took turns scanning

11
00:00:12,619 --> 00:00:13,759
the same tiny bottle

12
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,080
of alcohol, just to

13
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,019
keep the joke going.

14
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,359
Then, we decided to

15
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:18,899
take it up a

16
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,300
notch. My coworker scanned

17
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,460
an entire box of

18
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,100
pre -made shooters, 40

19
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,079
of them at $3

20
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,260
each, several times, adding

21
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,039
to the total. By

22
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,420
then, our running tally

23
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,379
was something like $2

24
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,399
,500. We were cracking

25
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,299
up, and it was

26
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,299
clear we'd done enough

27
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:38,780
to entertain ourselves. My

28
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,759
coworker had a bright

29
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,799
idea to check the

30
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,700
system and see if

31
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,640
there were any expensive

32
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,880
wines left on sale.

33
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,920
He found one worth

34
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,619
almost $10 ,000 and

35
00:00:47,619 --> 00:00:48,600
set the quantity to

36
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,979
$999, the maximum allowed.

37
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,100
Our total jumped to

38
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,039
around $9 million, and

39
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,740
we were still in

40
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,859
stitches. Things took a

41
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:58,640
turn for the worse

42
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,880
when my coworker spotted

43
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,159
another bottle worth nearly

44
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,920
$20 ,000. He added

45
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,700
it to the system,

46
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,159
setting the quantity to

47
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,379
$999 again, which brought

48
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,200
our total up to

49
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,219
around $28 million. That's

50
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:12,680
when I made a

51
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,879
mistake, I let out

52
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:14,659
a bit too much

53
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:15,739
laughter and pretended to

54
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:16,799
bring the transaction to

55
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,540
the point where we'd

56
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,640
confirmed the cash price.

57
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,519
But in that moment

58
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,299
of distraction, my coworker

59
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,219
didn't see me there,

60
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,680
and he accidentally pressed

61
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,560
enter, completing the transaction.

62
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,799
Suddenly, $28 million was

63
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:30,659
sitting in our cash

64
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,340
register's balance. I immediately

65
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,200
yelled at him to

66
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,000
figure out what had

67
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,280
happened, and his eyes

68
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,579
went wide with realization.

69
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,500
We knew we had

70
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,560
to reverse the entire

71
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,879
thing, but our system

72
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,079
only allows a maximum

73
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,540
of $1 million returns

74
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,719
at a time, so

75
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,480
it took us dozens

76
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,299
of attempts to get

77
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:48,299
every bottle back onto

78
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,700
the shelves. Now, as

79
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,319
I wait for my

80
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,400
store manager to come

81
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,799
in tomorrow, I'm bracing

82
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,159
myself for an explanation.

83
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,000
We know we messed

84
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
up, and our joke

85
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,159
has put our store's

86
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,140
stats and graphs in

87
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,239
jeopardy. Please keep your

88
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,319
fingers crossed for me,

89
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,620
I've accepted that we

90
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,599
deserve some kind of

91
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,680
punishment for our actions.

92
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,340
My boss was understandably

93
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,159
frustrated and disappointed, but

94
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,560
thankfully, it looks like

95
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,659
the worst case scenario

96
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:14,840
is just warnings or

97
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,740
a notation in our

98
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,139
files.
