1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
I lied to my

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:01,860
family about being at

3
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,899
an NBA game on

4
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:04,400
Christmas, but instead I

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,160
spent the day with

6
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,299
my dogs. My brother

7
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,279
caused a scene at

8
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,740
Thanksgiving, it was pretty

9
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,099
intense. He's always been

10
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,480
a problem child, and

11
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,279
I think he struggles

12
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,779
with bipolar disorder without

13
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,120
proper treatment. It's really

14
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,019
hard to watch him

15
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,039
go through this. He's

16
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,559
34 to 35 years

17
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,899
old, for years older

18
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:24,899
than me, and his

19
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,760
life has just been

20
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,000
one issue after another.

21
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,379
He had learning disabilities,

22
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,800
drove recklessly as a

23
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,380
teenager, and even smoked

24
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,579
marijuana in his car

25
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,179
on the way to

26
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:36,380
school. He's obsessed with

27
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,960
our relationship, trying to

28
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
fix it for the

29
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,159
past few years. I'm

30
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,179
nice to him, but

31
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,500
he takes everything personally.

32
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,219
Before Thanksgiving, I studied

33
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:46,899
up on how to

34
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,039
deal with highly insecure

35
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,399
people, but that didn't

36
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,299
make a difference. The

37
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,500
smallest thing sets him

38
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,539
off, and he picks

39
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:55,799
on me mercilessly. I

40
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,920
was 30 years old,

41
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,799
so I tried to

42
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,500
shut it down at

43
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,979
the gathering, barely speaking

44
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:02,039
to anyone. He ended

45
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,079
up threatening my younger

46
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,260
cousins for no reason,

47
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,500
just because they left

48
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,540
after he got upset.

49
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,659
My aunt stepped in,

50
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,980
telling our family that

51
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,000
he's not welcome around

52
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,200
our cousins again. I've

53
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,579
tried explaining this situation

54
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,019
to them before, they

55
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:16,920
know what's going on,

56
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,939
but don't know how

57
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,719
to help. So when

58
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,319
it came up at

59
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,640
Christmas, I told them

60
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,900
straight out, if he's

61
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,060
coming over, I'm not

62
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:24,819
going to deal with

63
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:26,640
it. They were upset,

64
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:27,760
and my aunt even

65
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,159
contacted our grandma to

66
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,260
convince him to change.

67
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,219
Then I got invited

68
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:33,379
to spend Christmas with

69
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:34,780
him, his wife, and

70
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,239
my sister, which included

71
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,180
my niece. I told

72
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,140
them I wasn't comfortable

73
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,500
around him, given his

74
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,159
bipolar disorder, the fact

75
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:42,920
that he doesn't take

76
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,480
medication, and what happened

77
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,640
at Thanksgiving. They didn't

78
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,560
listen or think I

79
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,560
was bluffing. I saw

80
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,680
an NBA game on

81
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,659
TV that year and

82
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,540
told everyone I was

83
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,239
going to the game,

84
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,920
but instead, I stayed

85
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,879
home with my dogs

86
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,700
for a stress -free

87
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,799
Christmas holiday for the

88
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:58,719
first time in five

89
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,079
years. I've decided not

90
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,900
to see or have

91
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,920
contact with him for

92
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,739
quite some time.
