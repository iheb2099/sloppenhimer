1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
I just paid off

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,960
our house two weeks

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,399
ago, a huge milestone

4
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,759
for us. We withdrew

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,620
some money from my

6
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,279
retirement accounts, which meant

7
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,300
no taxes on the

8
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,880
withdrawals, a nice bonus.

9
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,980
Now we're starting home

10
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,580
projects and saving 25

11
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,599
% of our income

12
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,859
for retirement. By our

13
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:19,359
age and salary, that's

14
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,679
already quite impressive. But

15
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,620
I'm not sharing this

16
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,679
with many people. As

17
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,899
someone in finance who's

18
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,019
managed to live comfortably

19
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,879
without going overboard, it's

20
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:29,559
hard for me to

21
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,539
keep this quiet. I

22
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:32,619
feel like screaming from

23
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,899
the rooftops, I can

24
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,659
afford it. And I

25
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:36,979
will retire at 62,

26
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,340
a goal I've been

27
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,560
working towards for years.

28
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,520
I'm not looking for

29
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,359
validation or sympathy, I

30
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,039
just want to share

31
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,359
my excitement and gratitude

32
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,420
with anyone who listen.

33
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,179
Thank you for being

34
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,119
part of this moment.
