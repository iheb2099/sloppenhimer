Some literally stopped wanting to be friends.\n\nMy family obviously doesn\u2019t know but since I live at home still it\u2019s kinda challenging.\n\nOne time I was coming back home at night and my mom asked why I\u2019m coming from the neighbors house. I acted dumb and said I was coming back from my car that was parked by the street.\n\nIt\u2019s double weird because my mom sort of knows the lady.\n\nWhy am I doing it? Idk girls my age seem to live in a different world. I don\u2019t do \u201cTikTok dances\u201d or know the latest cultural things. Im way too busy with work to be in a serious relationship.\n\nThe sex is pretty awesome. Sometimes we go at it for hours. To my knowledge she is divorced. She has a son who is like 2 years younger than me but I\u2019ve never actually met him. He\u2019s away for college and lives far away.\n\nSometimes her and I joke that it would be so weird explaining things. But then again we are mostly doing it for the physical aspect and out of convenience for both of us. So it\u2019s not a relationship.\n\nThe world is weird. Just thought to get it off my chest. I don\u2019t believe in paying for sex and dating was too exhausting so this is kinda where I\u2019m at right now. If anyone has questions I guess I can answer. Maybe this is more common than I realize and way less interesting to people. At least in my social circles I\u2019m in a league of 1 and all my friends don\u2019t really get it. Many of them act like they don\u2019t see how a woman in her 50s can be attractive. Obviously I feel the opposite way.",
