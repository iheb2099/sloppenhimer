  "body": "I feel genuinely awful typing this but I reallyyyyyy need to get it off my chest. I was visiting home for a few days and staying with my family. I didn\u2019t bring any of my own personal items with me which I didn\u2019t think twice about at the time. Being back in my childhood home put me in this weird mental space bored, out of routine. At one point early in the visit I noticed a vibrator in my sister\u2019s room. She\u2019s an adult. We both laughed it off in a joking immature way and she made some offhand comment about how it was one of those quieter ones she ordered online whisper line vibrators or something I didn\u2019t think much of it after that. Or at least I thought I didn\u2019t. A couple of days later my family went out to eat and I stayed behind. I had been sleeping, half awake, bored and alone in the house. For reasons I still don\u2019t fully understand that earlier moment came back into my head. I went to take a shower and instead of stopping myself like a normal rational person I went and took it. I honestly don\u2019t know what took over me. There was no planning, no justification, just a split second decision that I immediately regretted. The moment it was over I felt sick to my stomach. It hit me all at once how invasive disrespectful and wrong it was. It wasn\u2019t mine. It was extremely personal. Even though I cleaned it that doesn\u2019t undo what I did. The shame is mental, not practical.  \n  \nI feel disgusting when I think about it. Not in a dramatic way but in a quiet heavy way that sticks with you. I keep replaying it and asking myself why I didn\u2019t just walk away. I crossed a boundary that shouldn\u2019t ever be crossed especially with someone I care about. No one knows. I haven\u2019t told her. Part of me wonders if I should but I don\u2019t know if confessing would make it better or just hurt her for no reason. It was genuinely a one time lapse in judgment and I will never do anything like it again. Still it\u2019s one of those regrets that doesn\u2019t fade easily.  \n  \nI\u2019m not looking for validation or excuses. I know it was wrong. I just needed to admit it somewhere because carrying it around silently has been weighing on me.",
