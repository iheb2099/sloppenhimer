  "body": "I found out yesterday one of my parents stole a lot of money from me from my grandparents inheritance ( I am not angry about the money, I am angry about them stealing it ).\n\nI\u2019ve known that my grandparents had complicated things with my relatives and went to court over money. Every major conflict is about money money money. You spent your money poorly now your going to steal money from something that was never yours so the next generation can grow up without a normal family and an ongoing conflict in their life because they were too focused on themselves.\n\nDid you ever think about how this would impact the next generation? Your kid? No? I didn\u2019t think so. If you did, you would\u2019ve tried harder and had a bit more self respect and dedication to support connections within your family. That\u2019s the hard truth.\n\nI hope this all resolves itself. I don\u2019t particularly want to take my parents to court because of money. I don\u2019t particularly want to ruin the relationship I have with them because they were too greedy. \n\nMy confession is that I am going to take them to court if that\u2019s what it comes to. I don\u2019t really care if it drains them of every cent they have. My relationship with my parents is already so tainted I couldn\u2019t care less. I don\u2019t care about the money, I\u2019m already very financially stable. But I wish they hadn\u2019t stole it. Imagine your parents stole money dedicated to you from your late grandpa. \n\nSuch is life. I wish it wasn\u2019t like this.",
