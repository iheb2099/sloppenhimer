  "body": "I\u2019ll probably get downvoted for this because people may read it as arrogance, but I\u2019m just being honest about my life.\n\nI grew up in a lower-middle-income family, worked hard, saved consistently, learned how to invest, and managed to retire in my 50s with enough money to support myself long-term and live the way I want.\n\nThe difficult part is that many of my friends are still living paycheck to paycheck or dealing with ongoing financial stress. Some of that comes from circumstances, and some from never really learning personal finance and falling into cycles of debt.\n\nBecause of that, I don\u2019t feel comfortable sharing much about my own life anymore. I don\u2019t want to make anyone feel worse, but it also means I end up hiding big parts of who I am. People often say, \u201cJust find better friends,\u201d but it\u2019s not that simple\u2014many people are lonely and struggling to form real connections as it is.\n\nSo I guess this is me admitting, anonymously, that I\u2019ve built a life I\u2019m proud of on my own. I\u2019m grateful for it, even if it\u2019s something I mostly have to keep to myself.\n\n",
