  "body": "context: my parents got divorced(in a very ugly way) when I was around 10 and they constantly screamed and fought when I was growing up\n\n\na few weeks ago my mom told me her, my dad, and my grandmother were moving when their lease was up and she asked me if I would help her pack up some stuff in her and my dad's room. she wanted me to pack up this set of notebooks/planners beside her bed(probably about 50, she's kinda a hoarder) and in the process I found a notebook labeled \"please dont read unless youre *my mom's name*\" and of course my nosy ass had to open it. its 13 pages of my dad apologizing to my mom and genuinely explaining his behavior without excusing it. reading this was jarring, partially because I was unaware he had this level of emotions intelligence. I ended up taking pictures of all of the pages before I packed it away. I knew my parents dynamic changed around the time this was written(a family traumatic experience was happening, I dont want to elaborate)\n\nim sorry if this is poorly written, I genuinely don't have friends and my brother doesnt want to read the note, I need to get this out",
