  "body": "So this friend (24f) of mine (21f) has been in my life for over 10 years and I recently reconnected with her. She has two kids and another on the way. The thing is, I haven't done anything with her in years. We only get to go to her house because she never leaves without her husband or mom who both work full time. She refuses to drive even though she learned and is licensed. She pretty much won't let the kids go out with anyone but their dad or grandma so they're home all week with her. So basically my only option is to go visit them at her house. But she stares at her phone the entire time I am there, every single time. We talk briefly but she always goes back to the phone. Even her 5 year old daughter says \"my mom's always on her phone\" and her mom just goes \"well you're always on your tablet!\" It actually drives me crazy. I want her in my life and I want to be a part of the kids' lives but it honestly feels like none of them actually HAVE lives. It sucks to go to someone's house and just be ignored. I don't really know what to do. I've never expressed that this bothers me I guess because I feel like she'll just get upset and defensive. But it's really hard to stay around someone who's like this. How should I address this?\n\n\\*\\*TLDR: My friend doesn't leave the house without her mom or her husband, stays at home with her kids constantly, and when I go to her house - the only way we can usually hangout - she stares at her phone the majority of the time.\\*\\*",
