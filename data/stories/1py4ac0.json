  "body": "Last night around 2AM my stepdad and I were watching movies in the living room. Now, he's not really a conservative guy, but he does get a little squirmy around homosexuality, especially if he's been drinking. \n\nHe told me to put on whatever movie because he was going to go to bed (aka, he'll watch the first half and if he loses interest he'll go to bed). I saw Honey Don't! and didn't think much about it beyond \"I like Aubrey Plaza, sure\" and didn't think to look up the movie beyond the description, which didn't really mention LGBT or anything sexual in it.\n\nNow the first few scenes we did notice a bit of LGBT things, lesbian main characters and such, not a bit deal. Then the early drug scene where the guy who owes money tries to suck a guy's dick as \"a favor\" between payments... Well that stuck out as, maybe this movie is going to be a bit more than I hoped to watch around my step dad.. but we persisted for a bit. Then came the bar scene...Aubrey Plaza fingering the lead character on a date, turning into her head between her legs, very quickly.\n\nI shut the movie off, apologized and he went to bed, slightly traumatized, thinking I did this on purpose. Oops.\n\nTL;DR\nI unknowingly threw on a B-list Lesbian movie to watch with my homophobic step-dad over the holidays.",
