  "body": "Do you guys think my mom caught me masturbating? I do it pretty often and I always close my door when I do it. I think at this moment she did but not 100% sure, but this is what happened. I was masturbating and then my mom suddently opened the door to ask me a question about what we're going to have for dinner. When she opened the door it pulled the covers up fast. She said a little bit of what she was going to tell me and then she went \"uh-oh!\" To lessen what just happened I tried to continue on what she was saying. I told her what we should get for food, or eat something in the fridge. She answered everything I said. She never asked me what was I just doing. I did also get up and try to act normal and looked in the fridge to see what we had, and tried to bring things out. This happened 3 weeks ago. Now before she comes into my room she always knocks. She rarely used to knock when coming in but now she does it everytime I have the door closed. \n\n ",
