  "body": "New Year\u2019s Eve started out fine, but I clearly crossed a line and just kept going until I completely blacked out. I don\u2019t remember half the night, but the fragments I do have and the things my friends told me are enough to make me want to disappear.\n\nI woke up on New Year's Day in a state I can\u2019t even describe. I had shat myself. I had spent the night sleeping in my own vomit. But the absolute \"rock bottom\" moment was finding out that I was so far gone and unable to function that my friends literally had to hold my di*k for me to aim while I was trying to pee, just so I wouldn't soak myself even more than I already had.\n\nThe level of \"burden\" I put on them is what\u2019s eating me alive. These people had to clean up my mess literally while I was a dead-weight, disgusting version of myself. They were being good friends, but I feel like a complete sub-human knowing they had to see me like that.\n\nI am disappointed to my core. I\u2019m embarrassed, I\u2019m disgusted with my lack of control, and I feel like a total failure of an adult. I think this is the wake-up call I needed because I never, ever want to feel this low again. I don't even know how to begin apologizing or making it up to them.\n\n\nTLDR: I shat myself, slept in vomit, and my friends had to aim for me. I\u2019ve hit my absolute rock bottom. \n\nI've used AI to help structure this as English is not my first language. ",
