  "body": "I told my family I was at an NBA game for Christmas, I actually stayed home with my dogs.\n\nSo my brother caused a scene to say the least at thanksgiving. He has always been a problem. I think he is bipolar without proper health care. It\u2019s hard to watch. He\u2019s 34-35. He is 4 years older than I am and his whole life has just been a problem. He had learning disabilities, he would drive his car literaly 80-90 mph on the way to school in the morning and the car would reek of marijuana. He would threaten me that if I ever told he would make my life a living hell, he already was such a problem at the house i didn\u2019t want him to focus it on me.\n\nFor last 4-5 years he has been fixated on our relationship, how he wants to fix it. I\u2019m nice to him, I talk to him at get togethers. And in his mind this thanksgiving I was \u201con his team\u201d I studied a bunch of videos on how to deal with highly insecure people before thanksgiving. The smallest thing will set him off and he picks on me. I\u2019m 30 years old. So this thanksgiving every time he tried I shut it down and barely talked the entire get together. He ended up threatening my two younger cousins for literally no reason. In his mind they disrespected him, they left. I left. He apparently stood up on a couch because he thought my uncle said something about him. He didn\u2019t. \n\nMy aunt sent our side of the family basically ***** is not allowed to be anywhere near our cousins again. And I have tried to explain to my family this has been happening to me for a long time. They know, but they don\u2019t know what to do. So I took the opportunity to say look I\u2019m not doing anything if he\u2019s there either. My aunt was so upset about what he did that she contacted my nana. My nana knows about it and was crying convinced him to change. All this shit. \n\nThen I get invited over to Christmas with him his wife my sister and my niece. I said look you know I don\u2019t feel comfortable around him he\u2019s bipolar he doesn\u2019t take medication, you witnessed what he did on thanksgiving, and the only reason that was t directed towards me is because of the how to deal with mental health videos I watched. They didn\u2019t listen to me or thought I was bluffing.\n\nI noticed a NBA team was playing this year on Christmas Day. I told everyone in my family I was going to the game. I did not. I stayed home and watched Christmas movies, stress free for the first holiday in literally 5 years. \n\nI will not see or have contact with ***** for hopefully many many years. ",
