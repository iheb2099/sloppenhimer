  "body": "Hi everyone,\nA bit of a ramble, but advice would be appreciated. \n\nMy boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been together for a little less than a year. So far he\u2019s been an amazing partner. I love him and I do see a future together, but I can\u2019t get over how he behaves around my cat. \n\nMy cat isn\u2019t the cuddliest cat, is very particular about where he likes to be pet, and doesn\u2019t like to be held. Basically, he likes to be around people, but doesn\u2019t care for a lot of direct physical contact. He is more tolerant of me petting him because I\u2019m his person. This doesn\u2019t bother me, he\u2019s incredibly sweet and he\u2019s my little orange shadow.\n\nHowever, my boyfriend has little respect for my cat\u2019s boundaries and I\u2019m starting to get really frustrated. I\u2019ve explained to him very clearly, on multiple occasions, that my cat doesn\u2019t like to be held a lot and has his limits of where and how long he can be pet. My boyfriend ignores me, does all the things I tell him not to do, and then gets mad at my cat and calls him an asshole when my cat hisses or scratches him. He says things like he\u2019ll \u201cmake my cat learn to like being held\u201d and that \u201ctheir relationship is like that\u201d. When I tell him to cut it out, he also argues that other animals he\u2019s interacted with aren\u2019t like that, so my cat shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019m of the opinion my boyfriend is being an asshole, and he needs to leave my cat alone because you can\u2019t change a cat\u2019s well established boundaries. \n\nI\u2019m legitimately pissed off about this situation. He was antagonizing my cat again tonight and I kind of snapped and yelled at him to stop, but we didn\u2019t really acknowledge it and he went to bed. I don\u2019t want to go nuclear and break it off, but I\u2019m not really sure how to approach the conversation because he hasn\u2019t listened to me previously. Am I blowing things out of proportion seeing this as a major red flag and potentially a dealbreaker? How do I start a conversation about this without being accusatory, and make him understand I don\u2019t see his actions as cute fun, but rather disrespectful? \n\nBefore anyone asks, we don\u2019t live together and I\u2019m not financially dependent on him in any way, so I\u2019m not vulnerable in that regard. \n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend disrespects my cat\u2019s boundaries and I\u2019m not sure how to approach the situation.
