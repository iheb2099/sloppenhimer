  "body": "If I stay at a hotel with the those mini shampoo bottles, yes I\u2019ll take those\u2026  But what really tickles my fancy is when hotels have those attached shampoo bottles, I\u2019ll get an empty plastic water bottle and fill up the bottle to take home.\n\nI haven\u2019t purchased shampoo for myself in over 5 years because I have an overwhelming amount of hotel shampoo.\n\nEdit: well\u2026didn\u2019t expect this post to gain so much traction. I got a lot of responses asking if I wanted congratulations?  No?  I\u2019m in r/confession, not looking for any praise.  Also\u2026.so many of yall think I book hotels just for taking their shampoo\u2026.no.  I don\u2019t book hotels for shampoo, I take shampoo IF I happen to stay at a hotel (which was 8 different times this year, if you needed to know)\n\nA lot of yall have addressed the cheapness of my action and calling me a a$$hole a few times.  This is /r/confession, this isn\u2019t r/aitha.  So for those of yall who want to call people out on that, you should go to the appropriate subreddit.  I can afford shampoo, I just wanted to confess I have a weird nack for taking shampoo from hotels.  I know hotel shampoo is cheap, but hyatts (the hotels I stay the most at) are one of the better shampoos imo.\n\nBut yeah, some of yall should check which subreddit you\u2019re in and get off your high horse. \ud83d\udc0e",
