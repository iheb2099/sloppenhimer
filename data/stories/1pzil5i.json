By the time I hobbled to the bathroom it turned out it was a poo. I did the deed and instantly felt better. The poo itself was to my shock pretty large and had that \u2018beer shit\u2019 smell.\n\nI then went to flush and to my horror it would not go down at all. I waited a few moments and flushed again, but still no luck. Eventually I began to panic about the noise and the smell so I decided I\u2019d remove it some other way. The window to the bathroom was already slightly open (second story), so I grabbed my giant turd with some toilet paper as a barrier and flung it as far as I could into the neighbours yard. I even heard to crash into a part of the fence with a loud \u2018thud\u2019.\n\nI\u2019ve never mentioned this to anyone.\n",
