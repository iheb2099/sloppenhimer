  "body": "Hi all \u2014 I\u2019m looking for outside perspective on whether I\u2019m handling this reasonably.\n\nMy girlfriend (26) and I (29) have been together for 6 years. We met in college and have grown a lot together. She\u2019s a genuinely kind, supportive, and loving partner, and I care deeply about her.\n\nAs we\u2019ve started having more serious conversations about marriage, a few major topics have come up that I want clarity on before getting engaged \u2014 primarily sexual compatibility and finances.\n\nSexually, I have a higher drive and would ideally want intimacy 1\u20132 times per week. She\u2019s comfortable with closer to once every 2\u20133 weeks and rarely initiates or suggests variety. I\u2019m almost always the one initiating or trying to keep things fresh. Over time, this has started to feel unbalanced, and I\u2019m worried about long-term resentment if it doesn\u2019t improve.\n\nFinancially, I\u2019m very focused on saving and long-term planning. I bought a townhome, run a small side business in addition to primary W2 job, and prioritize financial security. She values experiences and travel more. We travel together a couple times a year, but she also takes additional trips with friends. I usually opt out to save money. Recently, while discussing future goals like buying a single-family home, she said that if she couldn\u2019t continue traveling at the same pace, she wouldn\u2019t want to buy a home. That surprised me and raised concerns about alignment.\n\nBecause these feel like core marriage-level issues, I suggested couples counseling before moving forward. She\u2019s strongly opposed unless we\u2019re engaged. Her view is that counseling is a \u201cwife-level\u201d commitment and doesn\u2019t make sense without an engagement. She also doesn\u2019t like the idea of talking to a stranger and feels we should be able to work things out ourselves. We did try counseling once (online) and didn\u2019t like the counselor, but I\u2019ve suggested finding someone in person instead.\n\nShe\u2019s now agreed to go, but says she doesn\u2019t see the point and would likely say that in the session. She\u2019s also shared that my hesitancy around engagement makes her feel like she\u2019s \u201cnot good enough,\u201d which I never intended but understand how it feels that way to her.\n\nI\u2019m struggling to figure out whether I\u2019m being overly cautious or if counseling before engagement is reasonable. To me, it feels like a way to strengthen the foundation and avoid future resentment. To her, it feels like an unnecessary hurdle without a formal commitment.\n\nHow do we move forward? or are we fundamentally misaligned in how we approach commitment and problem-solving?\n\nTL;DR:\n\nTogether 6 years and discussing marriage, but we\u2019re misaligned on sex frequency and finances. I want couples counseling before engagement to work through these issues; she believes counseling is a \u201cwife-level\u201d commitment and won\u2019t do it unless we\u2019re engaged.",
