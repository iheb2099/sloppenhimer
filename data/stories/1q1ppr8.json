  "body": "I grew up really poor. When I was about 5, my mom was visibly upset because she couldn\u2019t afford to get cake mix for my birthday cake. All she had was the ingredients to make a German chocolate cake. I instantly told her that was my favorite cake ever. It definitely was not. I hate chocolate and I hate coconut even more. Every year since then for my birthday she makes me a German chocolate birthday cake and is so super excited and it takes all I have to choke down a single slice. When she sends it home with me, I toss it right in the trash. She\u2019s much older now and I will never tell her the truth. \n\nEdit:  I see many of you saying tell her softly, but she\u2019s in her 70s now and her health is failing rapidly. She struggles to make anything in the kitchen now due to her health as it is and probably won\u2019t be with us more than a few more years if we are lucky. I would hate to change it at all now. Honestly, no matter how much I hate it, I will miss her yearly birthday cake when she is gone. But thank you all. ",
