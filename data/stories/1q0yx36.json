  "body": "So, I've always known the whole \"wash things before you wear them\" thing was important, but this shirt was a gift from my partner. I've been looking for white clothes for personal reasons since my wardrobe is pretty much entirely black, and it has my current favorite character \u200bon it. I really, *really* like this shirt and wanted to wear it, so I just threw it on straight out of the package.\n\nI'm sure this isn't as big of a deal with clothes you get from a physical store or something, but this was basically a freshly printed shirt that had been packaged and immediately sent out. I'm guessing it has traces of formaldehyde in the dye or something, that's all Google seems to be able to tell me.\n\nI also sweat in my sleep, regardless of the temperature - not enough to usually be an issue, though when it *does* get stupidly hot, I wake up in a bit of a puddle. It wasn't stupidly hot tonight, obviously, but I woke up dizzy and nearly sick from a horrible, permeating chemical smell that was clearly coming from my body and my sheets.\n\nThe only thing I could think of was the new shirt, I took it off and couldn't think of anything else to do put on my deodorant to stop the smell and open my window real wide to let out whatever fumes my dumbass concocted by being really excited about a shirt.\u200b\n\nHopefully I don't do something this stupid next year.\n\nTL;DR: If you get new clothes, fucking wash them before you put them on.
