  "body": "(Not today, a few weeks ago)\n\nMy house has a downstairs bathroom with an extractor fan - and the extractor fan vents outside the front of my house. There are also no windows.\nMy house is right on a small pavement, with my parking spaces opposite it (it\u2019s not as bad, or fancy, as it may sound!)\n\nA few weeks ago I came back from work at about 8pm, parked up, and walked past the extractor fan vent. \n\nEither my wife or one of the kids had it on and\u2026 clearly had a dicky tummy.\n\nI\u2019m 6\u20192. My nose is at the exact same height as the extractor fan vent. I stood by the vent to get my keys out, and got blasted in the face with\u2026 what was extracted, shall we say. \n\nNot the worst FU. Not by a long shot. However it t certainly stuck in my mind.\n\nTL:DR - I got blasted in the face by shitty trumpy smells when finding my keys, next to the bathroom extractor fan.\n\n",
