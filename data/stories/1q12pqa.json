  "body": "First time I make someone tea I make awful tea. The reason, I make great tea the Best cup of tea you ever had you will want to visit me just because my tea is so good. This is not a metaphor for anything. I genuinely mean tea.\n\nI used to run a garage that fixed or replaced commercial vehicle tyres. When the vehicles were getting fixed I\u2019d make a pot of tea. Nice cups, real full fat milk good Thompsons t bags and real sugar. Proper nice. Anyway I started noticing the drivers were brining biscuits and always seemed to land around tea break time. Sometimes there was nothing wrong with the tyres. Then finally when I was leaving they told me I make the best cuppa.\n\nSo in making a bad cup no one ever expects me to make tea now.\n\nEdit to add\n\nI\u2019m Irish.\n\nI was not the boss.\n\nI didn\u2019t own the company, I was being hospitable.\n\nI now no longer work in the same job. I now work in an office, I no longer deal with customers and I\u2019m not making tea for the whole office.\n\nMy tea bag tea is on power with loose tea. Don\u2019t judge until you try it.\n\nThe tea bags are made from a hemp byproduct.\n\nIt\u2019s black tea, not herbal.\n\nPeople choose themselves if they want to add milk and sugar.",
