  "body": "My (30F) husband (30M) and I are not doing well. We\u2019ve been together 8 years (married for one now), had our first baby now almost 17 months ago, and we have had sex once. One time. In now two years (since conception until now.) And I have had conversations with him about how it makes me feel, how I want things to change, how I just want a little bit of effort. Nothing has changed in these two years, and it\u2019s all came to a head finally and I just lost it on him.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that. When our daughter was born, she was premature (33.5 weeks) and in the NICU for two weeks. I didn\u2019t want visitors since I had had severe preeclampsia, but my in-laws came to see me after I was transferred to mother/baby, and essentially forced their way into the NICU to see her. So when I made the decision that we would be the only ones who visited her while she was in the NICU\u2014and her neonatologist even agreed with that\u2014I was called manipulative by my father in law. My husband told me that the night after he called me that. And now I have found out that they\u2019ve also been calling me vindictive, that I have been \u201ckeeping their grandchild away from them\u201d because they decide to show up unannounced at our house and then feel \u201crushed to leave\u201d, and a few other things\u2026 and when I told my husband that I wanted him to stand up for me and OUR child, he told me that he thought his parents and I needed to have a conversation and that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t play mediator.\u201d I have many instances of him not defending me or showing up for me emotionally (the biggest being when my dad died and he didn\u2019t come until the next day to see me\u2026 but only after playing tennis with his best friend, and then offered the excuse of \u201cnot wanting to believe it was real.\u201d)\n\nSo between all of this, the lack of intimacy in now \\*\\*YEARS\\*\\*, and feeling more like a roommate who co-parents with him, I feel like I cannot save my marriage at this point. I\u2019m going to a marital issue specialized counselor, and also told him that, but I don\u2019t know anymore. It feels like my conversations are being thrown at a wall. And I get it, truly, that intimacy is hard with a baby. Especially when they get older, \\*especially\\* when you don\u2019t have childcare options. But I don\u2019t feel like it should be like this.\n\nAlso, I know that I can initiate things. But it\u2019s also a principle of wanting to feel wanted by my spouse. And I have tried sending him like flirty/suggestive texts, but I always get \u201c\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\u201d in response, like it\u2019s a joke. Also, in the vane of defending me, he told me that he hadn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t ever had to defend his exes before. HA! That one stung a little, even though I\u2019m his longest relationship, wife, and mother of his child. He also told me that he was \u201cso focused on earning money and keeping us surviving financially\u201d while I\u2019m finishing my nursing bridge program in his defense to all of this, but I don\u2019t know how much that would matter if our marriage doesn\u2019t survive.\n\nLong winded text surmised, is this relationship salvageable, or is it something that is just slow-burn crashing?\n\nTL;DR: husband and I are in a stalled marriage after having our child, and are approaching two years of no intimate contact with zero resolution when issues are brought up.",
