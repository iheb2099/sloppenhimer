  "body": "I don\u2019t want to die, but I don\u2019t want to live another year like the last several years, and I can\u2019t see how a better life is ever going to be possible. My grown child causes me trauma every few months, my job pays barely enough to survive, my health and my looks are fading, and literally everything I\u2019ve tried to do to improve my life never works out in my favor. I don\u2019t know where I will get the strength to go through another year let alone the next 15-25 years before I die of old age. I want to be happy, and I want to be hopeful but at this stage of my life I feel like hope it\u2019s just stupidity, it\u2019s like believing in Santa Claus at age 50, as much as I might want too, it\u2019s impossible to do.
