  "body": "So I [M25] have been seeing this girl in my gym from the past couple of weeks. We haven't talked or met anything, just have had a few eye contacts here and there and a few hi-hello exchanges, nothing serious. \nToday while I was doing my cardio exercise of indoor cycling, I see her finishing up her weight training exercise and heading over towards me (her daily cardio part was left) so she came and started cycling on the cycle next to me. Again we exchanged hi-hello. But I noticed that she has colored/highlighted her hairs and her hair pony was looking all golden from the tip. And, honestly it was really suiting her and she was looking really great in it. So like any normal guy I went ahead to compliment her, and I said \"wow! you got your hair highlighted, it is really looking great on you\", she replied me with a normal thanks. Then I wanted to continue the conversation, so I went ahead and said \"You look like Eevee today and the highlighted hair pony looks like Eevee's tail'\" (pokemon reference) and started giggling. This entire thing was a compliment to her from my side. After this she looks at me with a puzzled look and says \"thanks i guess\" and it gets totally awkward between us. I soon realized that I weirded her out with my compliment so I quickly wrapped up my cycling and went away. The entire gym session I was feeling really guilty and sad about what I did earlier. \n\nTldr - Met this girl at the gym who was cycling next to me. She had highlighted her hairs with golden color, so I went ahead to compliment her by saying that she looks like Eevee from Pokemon. ",
