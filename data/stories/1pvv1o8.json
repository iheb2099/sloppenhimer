  "body": "I\u2019ve gifted my fianc\u00e9\u2019s grandma a couple of books for every holiday, but I\u2019ve mainly focused on family stories and historical novels.\n\nHis sister is into romance novels and we have read some of the same ones, so she gifted Gma a couple of spicy books. I just happened to notice, so I brought it up on the way home.\n\nI said, \u201cI was curious if you liked romance novels, since Sister gave you a couple today. I\u2019ve read Title and Title, and I really liked them!\u201d\n\nShe replied with, \u201cOh, yes, absolutely. I love romance novels.\u201d \n\nSo, I said, \u201cI just wanted to be sure. I have some recommendations you might really like, but they are occasionally graphic. I always want to make sure I\u2019m being appropriate with my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family!\u201d in a sort of playful tone.\n\nShe said, \u201cOh, I love to see a couple work through their problems. And some of the sex scenes, I mean, you can\u2019t help but get turned on.\u201d\n\nShe continued to describe her favorite things to read in romance and my fianc\u00e9 whispered, \u201cWhy would you do this to me?\u201d Now, he\u2019s heard WAY TOO MUCH. Oops. \ud83d\ude05 \n\nTL;DR - Asked Gma if she was okay with graphic scenes in romance, she told us how turned on she gets. Fianc\u00e9 is irreparably damaged.",
