  "body": "So today/yesterday (Australian time) I fucked up by trying to stay up until midnight for new years. Being 33 I am starting to dread the daunting task of staying up all the way until midnight for new years. This year I thought I could just drink coffee along with my alcohol to get me over the finish line. I don't normally drink coffee. We arrived at my friend's house at around 6pm. Already yawning and a few drinks deep, I asked my friend for a coffee. He asked if an espresso was fine and I said yes. At around 8pm, I felt more awake but thought one more would really perk me up, so I had another one. At around 11pm, caught up in the excitement of the night, I thought one more would see me over the finish line and the car ride home (girlfriend driving) and into a nice sleep at around 1:30am after getting home and showering. It is now 2pm AEST and I am still wide awake. I wish I was joking. I have been awake since 7am on Wednesday. That is 31 hours. I am wide awake now and probably won't sleep until tonight (another 8 hours or so). I know the half-life of caffeine would mean it's out of my system by now, but I think I'm too far into the day now and wide awake. I have not slept this year. Send help. \n\nTL:DR - I drank too much coffee and have not slept ",
