  "body": "Hi, I'm a 21M. I was involved with a 34F, I later discovered she was married. We met at a work event where I approached her, and we started talking about work. She asked for my number, and we later went for coffee. At that time, I didn't know she was married. After that, we went to her place and became intimate. She had removed all photos of her husband from the house, so I had no reason to suspect anything. Recently, a colleague told me she has been married since 2017. I was shocked and immediately cut off all contact. I feel bad for her husband. I just wanted to confess.",
