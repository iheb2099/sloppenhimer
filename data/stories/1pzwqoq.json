  "body": "My (33F) husband (33M) and I have been close friends with a married couple (both 32) since school (friends for 22 years). They\u2019re our best friends and we mostly have great times together which is why I don\u2019t want to lose the friendship.\n\nSince having our own children (both toddlers) the dynamic has shifted and everything feels like a financial competition. The husband is a high earner (\u00a3100\u2013200k, maybe more with commission) and his wife doesn\u2019t currently work, yet they\u2019re obsessed with being \u2018frugal\u2019 and always having a one-up.\n\nIf we mention a holiday, they\u2019ve done the same cheaper. If we buy something, they\u2019ll tell us they bought a cheaper or \u201cbetter\u201d version elsewhere. At Christmas, we bought our son a Toniebox and they made a point of explaining why their daughter\u2019s Yoto Mini is superior. The husband has also talked about retiring in 5\u201310 years (he\u2019s currently early 30s), which feels unnecessary given we work hard and realistically won\u2019t ever have that option.\n\nWe live very modestly (small house, second/third-hand cars, within our means etc.) but these comments leave me feeling subtly judged or framed as frivolous, even though I don\u2019t think they\u2019re trying to be unkind.\n\nI\u2019m looking for advice on:\n\n\u2022 What to say in the moment when the one-upping happens\n\n\u2022 Whether this is something worth addressing directly or if that would make things awkward.\n\n\u2022 How to mentally disengage so it doesn\u2019t keep bothering me.\n\n\u2022 Or whether this is just a sign the friendship dynamic has changed.\n\nI like them and don\u2019t want to end the friendship. I just want to stop feeling deflated after spending time together.\n\nTLDR: Long-term friends constantly one-up us financially. We live modestly and aren\u2019t competing but their comments leave me feeling judged and deflated after seeing them. I value the friendship and don\u2019t want to end it. I\u2019m looking for a way to respond and deal with the situation. ",
