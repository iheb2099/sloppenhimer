  "body": "So my husband and I just paid off our house 2 weeks ago.  Withdrew some money from retirement accounts (no taxation on the withdraws) and am starting the home projects and savings (25%) to retirement accounts - they are already at a fairly good number by standards 8x salary at our ages.  Sadly, I don\u2019t feel like I can share this with a lot of people.  I work in finance and have managed to live my life comfortably not over the top but well. I just want to shout it from the mountains because I can and will retire at 62!!!! Just wanted to get this out there!!! Thanks to all for reading! ",
