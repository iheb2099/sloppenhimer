  "body": " So, I was talking to a custodian that I typically have very long, friendly conversations with. We were talking about her daughter and wanting to give up her dog and I told her to talk to my girlfriend that works in another building. When I went to show her a picture to confirm we were talking about the same person the picture went through like a shuffle of photos of her and a very revealing (NOT fully nude) pic of her popped up. Of course I covered my phone immediately and I said \u201coh my god that\u2019s a bad bad picture!\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything but gave me a look and we kept talking for a bit before she left.\n\nI\u2019m left feeling so terrible and embarrassed and my first thought was \u201cI\u2019m 100% going to get fired\u2026\u201d \n\nSo, we will see what tomorrow brings, hopefully she keeps talking to me and I can apologize profusely. \n\nTL;DR Was talking to female custodian, referenced pic of girlfriend. Naughty pic came up on slideshow, I\u2019m a disgusting idiot who hopefully keeps her job.",
