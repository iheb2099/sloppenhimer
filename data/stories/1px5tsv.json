  "body": "My girlfriend were friends from high school and started dating about 2 years ago. We have an apartment and still live together and everything is all I can ask for.\n\nWe were both each other's first time doing NSFW. I loved it and so did she but after a few weeks she told me she was not wanting sex anymore. Uncomfortable and didn't like it. I respected it and we lived together for two years without having sex. Cuddles sure we're fine but that was it. Maybe this was my mistake but as of recently everything else is perfect and we have a lot of fun.\n\nI told myself the sex is not that important and she genuinely is a wonderful person. Close to no arguments, similar hobbies, pretty and we go out often.\n\nRecently, at 1 am she asked me if I'd like to have sex with her. I promptly agreed and it was great. We talked about doing it more often and she also agreed. It has been a few weeks and she always tells me its just not the right time when I ask. I respect it of course, but im not sure what to do. I do have a high libido and this is something I'd like to have in my life. I dont want to end things because she is great and I'm afraid not to have anyone. I am worried we will go into a loop again. How should I move forward with this?\n\nTLDR: girlfriend liked sex at first, but only for first few weeks. after 2 years of no nsfw she asks me if I'd like to do stuff one more time. We do but weeks go by and avoids any asking doing it again. How can I have a mature conversation to her about this without coming off poorly?",
