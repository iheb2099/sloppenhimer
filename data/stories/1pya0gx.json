  "body": "My dad was born in 1925 and my mom in 1964. Because of the massive age gap, I was so embarrassed as a kid that I lied to everyone and said he was my grandfather. \u200bHe passed away 12 years ago, and I still haven\u2019t corrected the lie. \u200bMost of my long-term friends still think I lost a grandfather, not my father. It feels like I\u2019ve erased his real role in my life just to avoid the \"gross\" looks and the math people do when they realize he was 40 when my mom was born. \u200bI feel like I betrayed him by being ashamed of him until the very end, and now it\u2019s too late to take it back.",
