  "body": "\nThis happened last week and I\u2019m still not sure if I should apologize again or just let it die.\n\nI was in a meeting with a coworker I don\u2019t work closely with very often. We were discussing how to approach a project that\u2019s been dragging on forever, and I proposed a change that would shift some responsibility off my plate and onto his team. Not intentionally malicious, just\u2026 convenient for me.\n\nI explained my idea, gave my reasoning, and then stopped talking. He nodded slowly and didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nMy brain immediately interpreted this as agreement.\n\nSo I kept going.\n\nI outlined timelines, deliverables, even said something along the lines of, \u201cCool, glad we\u2019re aligned.\u201d He still didn\u2019t interrupt me, just nodded and took notes.\n\nLater that day, I got an email from his manager asking why I had told my coworker that his team had already agreed to take on additional work. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t been agreeing, he\u2019d been processing and planning how to push back without starting a conflict in the meeting.\n\nNow it looks like I steamrolled him and misrepresented his position. I apologized to him directly, and he was polite but very clearly annoyed.\n\nI have learned that silence does not mean yes. Sometimes it means \u201cI am deciding how to deal with you.\u201d\n\nTL;DR: Mistook silence for agreement in a work discussion and accidentally volunteered someone else\u2019s team for extra work.",
