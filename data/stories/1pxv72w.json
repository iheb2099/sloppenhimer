  "body": "For the past few months I've had intense urges and really want to remove my eyeball. It's gotten to the point where I can't stop thinking about it and I'm struggling to cope with anything else. This desire to remove my eye also feels like a need, and I can't find a way to \"accidentally\" remove it. I'm 15M and I managed to get to see a counsellor in about 4 weeks. I want to tell them about this and how to stop thinking this way about my eye, but due to me being a minor, they would have to inform my parents about my issue, which is something I don't want. I don't know if I might have some sort of mental disorder, like OCD, BIID (though BIID is not officially recognised here in the UK) or some sort of episode or something.",
