  "body": "From 2010 to 2024. I transferred to 3 seperate colleges. It was rough. Some years I had a full course load, some years I had none. But it's done now, completed, and I am proud to be a degree holder. I'm not sure how much it's worth now, considering I'm at least one generation behind my peers in the work flow, but I'm still glad I was able to complete it.\n\nMy advice to others: Don't get pressured to switch your major because your peers say a liberal arts degree is worthless. It isn't. Don't take time off from school like I did because it is hard to get into the habit of taking classes full time. Pace yourself, and make sure to have a proper school/work/life balance. Go to the best school you can afford, the classes are better.\n\nI'm so happy to have achieved my bachelor's, and I have my degree proudly displayed in my room. It feels like an accomplishment, and my feeling is better late than never.",
