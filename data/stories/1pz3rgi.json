  "body": "I\u2019m an 18-year-old woman, and I\u2019ve been carrying a lot of guilt, shame, and self-hatred over sexual experiences that happened repeatedly throughout my childhood. I\u2019m posting because I don\u2019t know how to reconcile what I understand now with what happened then.\n\nFrom very early elementary school, there were multiple situations involving other children where boundaries weren\u2019t clear, adults weren\u2019t supervising closely, and I had no real understanding of sex, consent, or consequences. At the time, it felt confusing and overwhelming rather than intentional or thought-out. Sometimes I went along with things, sometimes I didn\u2019t fully know how to respond, and sometimes I was just copying behavior without understanding what it meant. Because of that, I\u2019ve struggled deeply with blaming myself.\n\nAs I got older, early exposure to sexual content made things more complicated. I didn\u2019t know how to process what I was seeing, and I repeated behaviors without understanding the harm, meaning, or emotional weight behind them. When adults eventually became aware and intervened, the behaviors stopped, but the shame never did. I haven\u2019t engaged in anything like this since early adolescence.\n\nNow, with adult awareness, everything feels different. I look back and feel intense guilt and disgust toward myself, even though I know logically that I was a child without the brain development or understanding to make informed choices. I constantly question whether I\u2019m a bad person, whether I deserve love, and whether my future is somehow damaged because of this. I also worry about how others would see me if they knew, and that fear keeps the shame alive.\n\nI understand, intellectually, that children don\u2019t process things the way adults do \u2014 but emotionally, I feel stuck. I feel responsible for things that happened before I had the capacity to understand what I was participating in. I want to heal, but I don\u2019t know how to let go of guilt when my adult mind keeps judging my child self.\n\nI\u2019m not looking for validation to excuse harm \u2014 I\u2019m looking for perspective, honesty, and insight from people who understand childhood trauma, early sexual exposure, or complicated shame. How do you move forward when your logic says one thing, but your emotions say another?\n\nPlease be kind. I\u2019m already struggling a lot with this.\n",
